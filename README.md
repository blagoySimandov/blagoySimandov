# Hey there 👋

I'm **Blagoy**, a CS student from Bulgaria currently based in Cork, Ireland. I like building things that people actually use - sometimes they even come back.

When I'm not writing code, I'm probably writing on my [blog](https://simandoff.blog) or convincing myself that *this* side project will be the one I actually finish.

**Currently:** Building things at Abraxa and pretending to study at UCC.

**Previously:** Taught kids to code, built a [real estate aggregator](https://github.com/blagoySimandov/homehive-be), built a chat app, developed an attorney "marketplace", and launched an [AI meal planner](https://github.com/blagoySimandov/prepcart-fe)...

So I've been busy :D

### Things I reach for

`Go` `TypeScript` `Python` `Rust` `Kubernetes` `Terraform` `GraphQL` `CockroachDB` `Redis`

...and whatever else gets the job done.
